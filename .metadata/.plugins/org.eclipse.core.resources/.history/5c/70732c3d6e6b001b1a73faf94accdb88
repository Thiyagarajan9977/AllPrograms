//SingleTone is one of design pattern in java
//one class having one object
//Whenever we need result as variable, 
//Need to set variable as returnType
//Whenever we need result as object, 
//Need to set class Name as returnType

//SingleTone Rule :

// 1. Need to declare the private constructor - Bcoz
// other class not suppose to create new object
// 2. declare the object as static

public class SingleTon {		//Class Name
	
	Static SingleTon e;
	
	
public SingleTon() {			//Constructor Creation
	
	}	
	
	public static SingleTon getinstance() {
		
		if(e==null) {
			e=new SingleTon();
			
			System.out.println(System.identityHashCode(e));
			return e;
		}
	}
	
	public void empid() {
		System.out.println("Hai");
	}
	
	public void mai() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}
