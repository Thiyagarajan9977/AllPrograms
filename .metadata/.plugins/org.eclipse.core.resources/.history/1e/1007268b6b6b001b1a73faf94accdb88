//SingleTone is one of design pattern in java
//one class having one object
//Whenever we need result as variable, 
//Need to set variable as returnType
//Whenever we need result as object, 
//Need to set class Name as returnType

//SingleTone Rule :

// 1. Need to declare the private constructor - Bcoz
// other class not suppose to create new object
// 2. declare the object as static

public class SingleTon {
	
	private SingleTon() {
	
	}	
	
	public static SingleTon getinstance() {
		if(e==null) {
			e=new SingleTon();
			
			System.out.println(System.identityHashCode(e));
			return e;
		}
		// 

	}
